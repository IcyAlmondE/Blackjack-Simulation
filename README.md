# Blackjack Simulation
This is the final project of ESC776: Into the Complex World (Semester 2/2022)

## Introduction
Blackjack is one of the popular gambling games in the casino, but many people are playing just for fun too. The main objective of the game is to reach the score closest to 21 as possible. The rule of the game is pretty simple: you get 2 cards at first and you decide if you want to call for more cards, but if your card exceeds 21 points, you lose immediately.

So the objective of this project is to find the best strategy to play blackjack to minimize your loss by using Monte-Carlo method to determine the number of points which you should stop calling for more cards.

This project explores 2 ways of playing blackjack against the house: playing with 1 deck and 4 decks. A deck of card contains 52 unique cards. Numbered cards have the score of those numbers. J, Q, K cards have the score of 10. A cards have the score of 10 but if the overall score exceeds 21, the score decreases to 1.
